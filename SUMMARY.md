# Implementation Summary

## What Was Built

A complete React-based OBS widget for Titled Tuesday chess streamers with the following features:

### ✅ Core Features Implemented

1. **Complete Result Code Handling**
   - Handles all 15 Chess.com result codes
   - Properly categorizes into Win (1), Loss (8), Draw (6)
   - Codes: win, checkmated, timeout, resigned, abandoned, lose, agreed, repetition, stalemate, insufficient, 50move, timevsinsufficient, kingofthehill, threecheck, bughousepartnerlose
   - Unknown codes default to draw with console warning

2. **Smart Date Filtering**
   - Only shows games from today and yesterday
   - Filters specifically for Titled Tuesday tournaments
   - Uses `end_time` from Chess.com API to determine game dates

3. **Auto-Polling System**
   - Polls Chess.com API every 30 seconds
   - Detects new games automatically
   - Immediately analyzes and displays new games when detected
   - Maintains accurate game count to avoid re-analyzing

4. **External API Evaluation**
   - Uses `eval.plc.hadron43.in` for position evaluation
   - Extracts FEN from each move in PGN
   - Evaluates positions before and after each player move
   - Calculates centipawn loss per move
   - Sequential API calls to avoid rate limiting

5. **Real-Time Accuracy Streaming**
   - Updates accuracy as each move is analyzed
   - Streams intermediate results to the UI
   - Shows progress for each game being analyzed
   - Recalculates average accuracy in real-time
   - Uses proper accuracy formula: `103.1668 * exp(-0.04354 * cpLoss/100) - 3.1669`

6. **Responsive UI**
   - Fixed overflow issues in round results grid
   - Uses `minmax(0, 1fr)` for proper grid sizing
   - Smaller fonts and gaps for 11 rounds
   - Proper text wrapping and sizing

7. **OBS-Ready Design**
   - Chroma green (#00FF00) background
   - High contrast black elements with transparency
   - Compact 340px width design
   - All elements properly sized for stream overlay

└── main.tsx                   - React entry point
```

### 🔧 Technical Implementation

**Date Filtering (`chessComApi.ts`):**
```typescript
const isGameFromTodayOrYesterday = (endTime: number): boolean => {
  const gameDate = new Date(endTime * 1000);
  const todayStart = new Date(now.getFullYear(), now.getMonth(), now.getDate());
  const yesterdayStart = new Date(todayStart);
  yesterdayStart.setDate(yesterdayStart.getDate() - 1);
  return gameDate >= yesterdayStart;
};
```

**Polling Logic (`App.tsx`):**
```typescript
useEffect(() => {
  const pollInterval = setInterval(async () => {
    const ttGames = filterTitledTuesdayGames(fetchedGames, username);
    if (ttGames.length > lastGameCount) {
      // New games detected - analyze them
      analyzeNewGames(newGames, username, ttGames);
    }
  }, 30000); // Every 30 seconds
}, [username, lastGameCount]);
```

**Real-Time Accuracy Updates:**
```typescript
const accuracy = await analyzeGame(
  game.pgn,
  playerColor,
  (currentAccuracy, moveNum, totalMoves) => {
    // Update UI immediately with intermediate accuracy
    setGames([...analyzedGames]);
    setAverageAccuracy(calculateAverage());
  }
);
```

### 🎮 Usage

1. Run `npm install && npm run dev`
2. Open `http://localhost:5173/?username=viditchess`
3. Add to OBS as Browser Source
4. Apply Chroma Key filter (green)

The widget will:
- Load today's/yesterday's Titled Tuesday games
- Analyze each game with Stockfish depth 14
- Show real-time accuracy updates
- Poll for new games every 30 seconds
- Auto-update when new games finish

### 🚀 Performance Notes

- External API evaluation takes time (network latency per position)
- Polling runs in background without blocking UI
- Sequential API calls to avoid rate limiting
- Accuracy streams in real-time as moves are analyzed
- Only analyzes games that don't have accuracy yet
- Estimated ~1-2 seconds per move (depending on API response)

### 🎨 Design Details

- **Chroma Green Background:** `#00FF00` for easy OBS removal
- **Dark Elements:** `rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.85)` with white text for contrast
- **Color Coding:**
  - Green (#22c55e) - Win
  - Red (#ef4444) - Loss
  - Gray (#9ca3af) - Draw
  - Dark Gray (#374151) - Not played
- **Compact Layout:** 340px width, suitable for corner overlay
