## How It Works

### Game Filtering
- Fetches games from Chess.com API for current month
- Filters to only Titled Tuesday tournaments
- Shows only games from today and yesterday
- Automatically detects new games every 30 seconds

### Accuracy Analysis
- Uses external evaluation API: `eval.plc.hadron43.in`
- Extracts FEN positions from PGN for each move
- Evaluates positions before and after player moves
- Calculates centipawn loss per move
- Converts centipawn loss to accuracy percentage
- Streams updates in real-time during analysis
- Formula: `103.1668 * exp(-0.04354 * cpLoss/100) - 3.1669`

### API

The widget fetches data from Chess.com's public API:
- `https://api.chess.com/pub/player/{username}/games/{year}/{month}`

## Tech Stack

- React 18 + TypeScript
- Vite
- Chess.js for PGN parsing and FEN extraction
- External Evaluation API for position analysis

## Notes

- Analysis takes time as API is called for each position
- Accuracy updates stream in real-time as positions are evaluated
- Widget continues polling in background for new games
- Designed for 340px width for compact stream overlay
- API calls are sequential to avoid rate limiting
